        <div class="headline">Energy-Efficient Hull Designs</div>
        <p>Modern hull designs aim to reduce water resistance and improve fuel efficiency. Techniques such as hull optimization and air lubrication systems are being employed to enhance the hydrodynamics of ships.</p>
        <h3>Hull Optimization</h3>
        <p>Advanced computer simulations and AI algorithms are used to design hulls that minimize drag and maximize fuel efficiency.</p>
        <h3>Air Lubrication Systems</h3>
        <p>These systems create a layer of air bubbles along the hull, reducing friction between the hull and water, leading to significant fuel savings.</p>

    <section>
        <div class="headline">Use of Renewable Energy Sources</div>
        <p>Integrating renewable energy sources into ship design is becoming increasingly common. Solar panels, wind turbines, and even hydrogen fuel cells are being explored to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
        <h3>Solar Power</h3>
        <p>Solar panels installed on ship decks generate electricity, supplementing the ship's power needs and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
        <h3>Wind Power</h3>
        <p>Wind-assisted propulsion systems, such as rotor sails and kite sails, harness wind energy to aid in propulsion and reduce fuel usage.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <div class="headline">Advanced Propulsion Systems</div>
        <p>Innovative propulsion systems are being developed to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions. These systems include electric propulsion, LNG (liquefied natural gas) engines, and hybrid propulsion systems.</p>
        <h3>Electric Propulsion</h3>
        <p>Electric motors powered by batteries or fuel cells offer a cleaner alternative to traditional diesel engines.</p>
        <h3>LNG Engines</h3>
        <p>LNG is a cleaner-burning fuel that reduces sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions compared to conventional marine fuels.</p>
        <h3>Hybrid Propulsion</h3>
        <p>Combining conventional engines with electric propulsion systems provides flexibility and efficiency, especially in varying operational conditions.</p>

        <div class="headline">Sustainable Materials and Construction Techniques</div>
        <p>Using sustainable materials and innovative construction techniques can significantly reduce the environmental impact of shipbuilding.</p>
        <h3>Eco-Friendly Materials</h3>
        <p>Recyclable and biodegradable materials, such as composites and bio-based materials, are being used in ship construction.</p>
        <h3>Modular Construction</h3>
        <p>Prefabricated modules assembled in shipyards reduce construction time, waste, and energy consumption.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <div class="headline">Emission Reduction Technologies</div>
        <p>Advanced technologies are being implemented to capture and reduce emissions from ships.</p>
        <h3>Scrubbers</h3>
        <p>Exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as scrubbers, remove sulfur oxides (SOx) from ship emissions.</p>
        <h3>Carbon Capture</h3>
        <p>Technologies that capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from ship exhausts are being explored to reduce the carbon footprint.</p>

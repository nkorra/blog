    "        <h2>Historical Overview</h2>\n",
    "        <p>From the earliest wooden vessels to the modern steel giants, the evolution of ship design reflects the progress in engineering, materials science, and technological innovation.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>Ancient Ships:</h3>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Egyptian Ships:</strong> The earliest known ships were used by the Egyptians around 3000 BC. These ships were primarily made of reeds and used for navigating the Nile River.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Greek and Roman Ships:</strong> The Greeks and Romans made significant advancements in shipbuilding, including the use of multiple rows of oars (triremes) and the introduction of the sail.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>Medieval Ships:</h3>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Viking Ships:</strong> Renowned for their speed and agility, Viking longships were clinker-built and could navigate both open seas and shallow rivers.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Cogs and Caravels:</strong> The Hanseatic League and explorers like Columbus used these robust, multi-masted ships for trade and exploration.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>Modern Ships:</h3>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Steamships:</strong> The advent of steam power in the 19th century revolutionized ship design, allowing for larger vessels and more reliable navigation.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Steel Ships:</strong> The transition from wood to steel in the late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a significant leap in ship durability and size.</p>\n",

    "        <h2>Key Innovations in Ship Design</h2>\n",
    "        <h3>Hydrodynamics:</h3>\n",
    "        <p>Understanding the interaction between water and ship hulls has been crucial in optimizing ship speed and fuel efficiency. The development of bulbous bows and streamlined hulls are key examples of hydrodynamic innovations.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>Propulsion Systems:</h3>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Steam Engines:</strong> Introduced in the early 19th century, steam engines replaced sails and oars, allowing ships to travel faster and more reliably.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Diesel Engines:</strong> By the early 20th century, diesel engines offered more efficiency and power, becoming the standard for most large vessels.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>Nuclear Propulsion:</strong> Used primarily in military vessels and icebreakers, nuclear propulsion offers virtually unlimited range and endurance.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>Materials:</h3>\n",
    "        <p>The evolution from wood to iron and steel significantly increased the strength and size of ships. Modern materials, including composites and advanced alloys, continue to enhance ship performance and reduce weight.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>Automation and Digitalization:</h3>\n",
    "        <p>The integration of automated systems and digital technologies has transformed ship operations. Navigation systems, engine monitoring, and cargo management are now highly automated, improving safety and efficiency.</p>\n",

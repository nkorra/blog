        <div class="headline">Ship Structural Analysis</div>
        <p>FEM is extensively used in the structural analysis of ships. By creating detailed finite element models, engineers can assess the strength, stiffness, and stability of the ship's structure under different loading conditions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hull Girder Analysis:</strong> FEM helps in analyzing the global bending and shear responses of the hull girder, ensuring the ship's overall structural integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Structural Analysis:</strong> Detailed FEM models of specific areas, such as bulkheads, decks, and joints, help identify stress concentrations and potential failure points.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="headline">Offshore Structures</div>
        <p>Offshore structures, such as oil rigs and wind turbines, are subjected to harsh marine environments. FEM is crucial in designing these structures to withstand the dynamic loads from waves, wind, and currents.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> FEM allows for the evaluation of static loads and the design of structures to withstand them without excessive deformation or failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Analysis:</strong> By performing dynamic analysis, engineers can predict the response of offshore structures to wave-induced vibrations and other dynamic forces.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="headline">Hydrodynamic Analysis</div>
        <p>FEM is also employed in hydrodynamic analysis to study the interaction between fluid and structures. This is essential for understanding the behavior of marine vessels and offshore platforms in the water.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wave-Structure Interaction:</strong> FEM helps simulate the impact of waves on structures, providing insights into wave loads and pressures on hulls and offshore platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Flow Analysis:</strong> Engineers use FEM to analyze fluid flow around structures, aiding in the design of hulls and appendages for improved hydrodynamic performance.</li>

        <div class="headline">Fatigue and Fracture Analysis</div>
        <p>Marine structures are often subjected to cyclic loading, leading to fatigue and potential fractures. FEM is used to predict the lifespan of structures by analyzing stress concentrations and fatigue hotspots.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fatigue Life Prediction:</strong> FEM models help estimate the number of cycles a structure can endure before failure, enabling proactive maintenance and design improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Fracture Mechanics:</strong> By simulating crack propagation, FEM assists in evaluating the integrity of structures and the effectiveness of repair techniques.</li>

        <div class="headline">Hull Design and Performance</div>
        <p>The design of a ship's hull significantly impacts its hydrodynamic performance. Factors such as shape, size, and surface characteristics determine the resistance encountered by the vessel as it moves through water. Optimizing hull design helps reduce drag, improve fuel efficiency, and enhance speed.</p>

        <div class="headline">Stability and Buoyancy</div>
        <p>Stability and buoyancy are vital aspects of ship design. Stability ensures that a vessel remains upright and balanced, even in rough seas, while buoyancy allows it to float. Hydrodynamic calculations help determine the appropriate center of gravity and buoyancy distribution for safe and stable operations.</p>

        <div class="headline">Wave-Structure Interactions</div>
        <p>Offshore structures, such as oil rigs and wind turbines, must withstand harsh marine conditions. Understanding wave-structure interactions is essential for designing robust platforms that can endure the forces exerted by waves, tides, and currents. Hydrodynamic analysis helps predict these interactions and inform structural design.</p>

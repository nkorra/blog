        <div class="headline">Floating Wind Turbines</div>
        <p>Floating wind turbines are revolutionizing offshore wind energy by allowing wind farms to be located in deeper waters, where wind speeds are higher and more stable. These turbines are anchored to the seabed using mooring lines and can be installed in water depths that fixed-bottom turbines cannot reach.</p>
